# Using the template
The easiest way to start developing is to fork our [Test Plugins](https://github.com/recloudstream/TestPlugins).

To get started:

1) <a href="https://github.com/recloudstream/TestPlugins/fork" target="_blank">Fork the Test Plugins</a>

2) Check if GitHub actions are enabled, by going to: `Settings > Actions > General > Allow all actions and reusable workflows`

3) Make sure workflows have push access in your repository, by going to: `Settings > Actions > General > Read and write permissions`

4) You can now create your own plugins and after you push new code, they should automatically be built
